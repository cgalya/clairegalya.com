    <h1>Tell us about yourself...</h1>
    <p>I am currently working in the Boston area as a web developer at ioVita.</p>
    <p>Since graduating from Brown University in 2008, I have worked as a farmer, baker, teacher, and now developer. While teaching science at an independent K-8 school in Manhattan, I began getting interested in technology after attending several tech and design thinking workshops.  Now I can't imagine my life without code.</p>
